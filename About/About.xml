If you have a smaller screen or mods that add a lot of work types (like my own [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3013527266]Many Jobs[/url] for instance) you may have encountered the heartbreak of the unreadable Work tab.

This mod is very simple. It rotates the column headers by 60° to make a crowded Work tab more usable.

Also included is the option to have vertically oriented column headers, for those who prefer an even more compact Work tab.

And as a bonus feature, [b]free gratis[/b], the mod enables scroll-wheel support for incrementing or decrementing work priorities. Just put your cursor over a priority box and scroll up or down. If manual priorities are disabled, scrolling will toggle the work type for the selected pawn. If manual priorities are on, scrolling up will raise the work type's priority, and scrolling down will lower it. 

All mod settings can be changed via RimWorld's mod options menu.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
This mod has been tested and found to be nicely compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1414302321]Numbers[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1994006442]Priority Master[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2340773428]Grouped Pawns Lists[/url]. It's [i]technically[/i] also compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=725219116]Fluffy's Work Tab[/url] (from which this mod took inspiration), but if you run them both at the same time Fluffy's mod will override the functionality of this one, so I recommend you don't do that.

Mods that add new work types to the game are fully compatible with Compact Work Tab.
